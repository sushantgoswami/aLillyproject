===================================================== 
WORKPLAN 1.0 for modifying resource on SG iptst_86
===================================================== 
## SA will blackout the server during the Activity
## DBA team should intimate UNIX team before database upgrade, so that SA will freeze the service group to prevent failover.
## After confirmation from DB team, unix will freeze the relevant SG iptst_86

haconf -dump
cp /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf-PRE-CR-number
haconf -makerw
hagrp -freeze iptst_86 -persistent

Unix team will now contact DB team and gave go ahead for DB upgrade.
Once DB upgraded modify the resources as below.

hares -modify iptst_86_oracle_tst_86 Sid tst_86
hares -modify iptst_86_oracle_tst_86 Owner oracle
hares -modify iptst_86_oracle_tst_86 Home "/iptst_86/oracle/product/root2_iptst_86"
hares -modify iptst_86_oracle_tst_86 Pfile "/iptst_86/oracle/admin/tst_86/pfile/inittst_86.ora"

hares -modify iptst_86_lsnr_1532 Critical 0
hares -modify iptst_86_lsnr_1532 Owner oracle
hares -modify iptst_86_lsnr_1532 Home "/iptst_86/oracle/product/root2_iptst_86"
hares -modify iptst_86_lsnr_1532 TnsAdmin "/oracle/local/dat"
hares -modify iptst_86_lsnr_1532 Listener lsnr_iptst_86_1532

Unfreeze the rosource
hagrp -unfreeze iptst_86 -persistent

Now online the resource by VCS method
hagrp -online iptst_86 -sys icmdi02

Do the failover testing by
hagrp -switch iptst_86 -to icmdi03
hagrp -switch iptst_86 -to icmdi02

haconf -dump -makero

=====================================================
OVERALL WORKFLOW
=====================================================
Unix team will blackout servers and freeze the SG persistent
DBA's will do their work and then give the servers back to Unix team. Database/listner will be stopped at this point
Unix team will unfreeze SG and make changes to VCS and online service group on icmdi02
DBA's will verify that database/lsnr came up successfully
Unix team will switch service group over to icmdi03
DBA's will verify that database/lsnr came up successfully
