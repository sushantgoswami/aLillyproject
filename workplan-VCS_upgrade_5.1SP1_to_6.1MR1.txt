***************************************************************
WORK PLAN for Upgrade Storage foundation/VCS  6.1MR1 on both cluster nodes:
Work plan also appliciable for upgrading only SF for SF only install execute only SF part.
***************************************************************

Note: ‘ssh’ should be configured to be used without the root password prompt so both nodes can be upgraded at the same time for VCS. Instructions for this are found on page 55 in the SFHA 6.1 installation guide.

1. Stop all service groups they are using vxfs fileysytem
- Make the cluster configuration read / write.
# haconf -makerw
- Persistent freeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
- Save and dump the cluster configuration.
# haconf -dump -makero
#cp /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/main.cf-PRE-CHG_no.

2. Run the 6.1 ./installer from installation software, and select upgrade option by G.

- Do you agree with the terms of the End User License Agreement as specified in the EULA.pdf file present on media? [y,n,q,?] y
- Select default '2' for what to install for VCS
- enter all node names when prompted.
- Answer 'y' to continue this installation.
 
--- At this point upgrade the any non-Bundled agents (i.e., Oracle, Sybase) on both nodes.
 
--- Check that the Types.cf has upgraded --- compare /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/Types.cf with /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/Types.cf --- the newer one is what should be under /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config.
 
3.  After completion of previous step persistent unfreeze service groups all nodes
Commands for doing this:
- Make the cluster configuration read / write.
# haconf -makerw
- Persistent unfreeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
4. Switch the service groups to other nodes than one to install Storage Foundation
Commands for doing this:
c) Switch all service groups from one node (to be upgraded in next step) to other node.
# hagrp -switch <service_group> -to <node>
5. Persistent freeze all nodes
Commands for doing this:
- Persistent freeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
- Save and dump the cluster configuration.
# haconf -dump –makero
 
--- At this point, all the cluster nodes should be running VCS 6.1.
 
Repeat the following steps, 6 – 9, for upgrading Storage Foundation for each node of the cluster:

Storage_Foundation(open)

6. Run ./installer to install Storage Foundation 6.1MR1 on node not having any service groups running
- Select Storage Foundation to install (option 2)
- Do you agree with the terms of the End User License Agreement as specified in the EULA.pdf file present on media? [y,n,q,?] y
- Select software to install, option 3 for all Storage Foundation product
- Enter node name installing Storage Foundation
- Answer 'y' to continue this installation.
---- Once the Storage Foundation installation has completed, reboot the system.
Now Install SF 6.1MR1 on this upgraded node:
# cd <6.1 MR> installation software

# ./installrp -upgrade_kernelpkgs <node>
Check the version of system:
# rpm –aq | grep vx, (pkginfo | grep -i vx in solaris)
…should show vxfs and vxvm at 6.1MR1.
Reboot the system

Storage_Foundation(close)

7.  After completion of previous step persistent unfreeze service groups all nodes
Commands for doing this:
- Make the cluster configuration read / write.
# haconf -makerw
- Persistent unfreeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
8. Switch the services groups from one of uninstalled Storage Foundation nodes to one just upgraded
Commands for doing this:
- Switch all service groups from one node (to be upgraded in next step) to other node.
# hagrp -switch <service_group> -to <node>
9. Persistent freeze all nodes
Commands for doing this:
- Persistent freeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
- Save and dump the cluster configuration.
# haconf -dump -makero
 
10. Repeat steps 6 - 9 until all nodes in the cluster have been upgraded to 6.1MR1RP2 for Storage Foundation.
11. After all nodes have Storage Foundation upgraded, persistent unfreeze all nodes
Commands for doing this:
- Make the cluster configuration read / write.
# haconf -makerw
- Persistent unfreeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
12. Run hastatus -sum
# hastatus -sum
13. Switch service groups to nodes where they are supposed to be running
Commands for doing this:
# hagrp -switch <service_group> -to <node>
- Save and dump the cluster configuration.
# haconf -dump –makero
 
-- At this point all cluster nodes should now have SF 6.1MR1 installed.
 
Now upgrade the nodes to VCS 6.1MR1
From the pdf that’s included in the 6.1MR1 installation software.
Rolling upgrades take two discrete phases. In the first, you upgrade the kernel
packages with exception of VCS packages and agent packages. In the second, you
upgrade the non-kernel packages, which are VCS packages and agents packages.
1.) Persistent freeze service groups on all nodes
Commands for doing this:
- Make the cluster configuration read / write.
# haconf -makerw
- Persistent freeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
- Save and dump the cluster configuration.
# haconf -dump -makero
2.) Change directory to the 6.1MR1 installation software and the ‘rpms’ directory.
# cd <6.1MR1RP2> installation software
# ./installmr 
--- Check that the Types.cf has upgraded --- compare /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/Types.cf with /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/Types.cf --- the newer one is what should be under /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config.
 
- Make the cluster configuration read / write.
# haconf -makerw
- Persistent unfreeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
- Save and dump the cluster configuration.
# haconf -dump -makero

14. Upgrade to SFHA 6.1MR1 is now completed.
