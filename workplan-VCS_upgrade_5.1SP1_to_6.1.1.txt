***************************************************************
WORK PLAN for Upgrade VCS  5.1SP1 to 6.1.1 on VCS cluster nodes:
***************************************************************

# Make sure ILOM is working for both server.
# Make sure root password is working on both servers.
# Make sure no service group is in PARTIAL/FAULTED state.
# Take configuration backup from output script.

Note: ‘ssh’ should be configured to be used without the root password prompt so both nodes can be upgraded at the same time for VCS. 
1. Persistent freeze service groups on all nodes
Commands for doing this:
- Make the cluster configuration read / write.
# haconf -makerw

- Persistent freeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeB>

# hastop -local -force
# service vxfen stop
# service gab stop
# service llt stop
 
- Save and dump the cluster configuration.
# haconf -dump -makero
2. Run the 6.1 ./installer from installation software, and select VCS only.
- Select 'Veritas Cluster Server' to install
- Do you agree with the terms of the End User License Agreement as specified in the EULA.pdf file present on media? [y,n,q,?] y
- Select 'G' to upgrade the cluster.
- enter all node names when prompted.
- Answer 'y' to continue this installation.
 
--- At this point upgrade the any non-Bundled agents (i.e., Oracle, Sybase) on both nodes.
 
--- Check that the Types.cf has upgraded --- compare /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/Types.cf with /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/Types.cf --- the newer one is what should be under /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config.

--- After completion all services will start automatically

--- Check the MultiNICA resource for IPV4 Route options.
 
3.  After completion of previous step persistent unfreeze service groups all nodes
Commands for doing this:


- Persistent unfreeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeB>
 
4. Now install the MR patch.

# haconf -makerw
- Persistent freeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -freeze -persistent <nodeB>

# hastop -local -force
# service vxfen stop
# service gab stop
# service llt stop

5. Run the 6.1.1 MR patch installer from VCS MR sorce directory.
# Run ./installmr from root of patch directory.
- Do you agree with the terms of the End User License Agreement as specified in the EULA.pdf file present on media? [y,n,q,?] y
- enter all node names when prompted.
- Answer 'y' to continue this installation.

--- At this point upgrade the any non-Bundled agents (i.e., Oracle, Sybase) on both nodes.
 
--- Check that the Types.cf has upgraded --- compare /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/Types.cf with /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config/Types.cf --- the newer one is what should be under /etc/VRTSvcs/conf/config.

--- After completion all services will start automatically

--- Check the MultiNICA resource for IPV4 Route options.

6.  After completion of previous step persistent unfreeze service groups all nodes
Commands for doing this:

- Persistent unfreeze each and all cluster systems (perform this step for each cluster node).
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeA>
# hasys -unfreeze -persistent <nodeB>

Now upgrade to 6.1.1 is done
