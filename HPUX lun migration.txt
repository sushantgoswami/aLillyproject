The lvmtab files should be having the VG00 entries and hope that they do.

To answer your questions.

a) Is there any way other than a vgscan to rebuild this information?

though vgscan is the easiest way, we do have the vgimport command to help rebuild the lvmtab file with entries for that particular vg. I would suggest the following be done

Collect the information about the vg's and pv's

# vgscan -p -v
Here we do a vgscan in preview mode, this helps to determine if the system is able to identify the disks to the volume groups.

or

# vgcfgrestore -l -f /etc/lvmconf/ should also help if it is the latest one and regularly updated.

Once you ascertain which are the disks that belong to the volume group

# cp -P /etc/lvmtab /etc/lvmtab. for backup
# mkdir /dev/vgname
# mknod /dev/vgname/group c 64 0xXX0000
where XX is teh minor number of the group

# vgimport -p -v /dev/vgname
The above command does the import in preview mode so taht you can correct any issues/errors. Once you clear all the errors

# vgimport -v /dev/vgname



b) Also, does it matter if minor number used in the mknod does not match the original minor used?

No it does not matter, however recommended.
